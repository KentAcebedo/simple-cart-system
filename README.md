# ShopHub - Responsive E-commerce Prototype

A clean, modern e-commerce product page built with a focus on responsive UI/UX and efficient front-end logic. This project demonstrates my ability to build functional web interfaces using modern styling frameworks and modular JavaScript.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Responsive Grid System:** Implemented a mobile-first product grid (1-2-4 columns) that adjusts seamlessly across all device sizes using Tailwind CSS.
* **Interactive Cart Logic:** Features a dynamic cart badge system that updates in real-time as users interact with the product cards.
* **Modern Navigation:** Includes a sticky header with a functional mobile hamburger menu for optimized user navigation on small screens.
* **Polished UI:** Utilized hover effects, transitions, and gradients to provide a high-end feel similar to top-tier e-commerce platforms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Structured for accessibility and SEO.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for rapid, utility-first responsive styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles the DOM manipulation for the cart count and mobile menu toggle.
* **Laravel-Ready:** The structure is built with a view toward being integrated into a Laravel Blade template system.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The main structure featuring semantic HTML5.
* `index.js` - Logic for the shopping cart counter and mobile navigation.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
* Integration with a **MySQL** database via **Laravel** for dynamic product loading.
* Implementing an AI-driven product recommendation system based on user browsing history.
